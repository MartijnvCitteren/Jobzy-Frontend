# Plan: Vacancy creation frontend (feature slug: `vacancy-creation`)

Status: FINAL — ready for `jobzy-frontend-developer`. **Revised 2026-09-20** for
design-parity with the real, high-fidelity handoff (see §10 below) — §1-9 are the
original architecture pass and remain valid except where §10 explicitly supersedes them.
**Further revised 2026-09-25** for a PO-reported fine-tuning pass on the shipped,
design-parity build (see §11 below) — §1-10 remain valid except where §11 explicitly
supersedes them.
Source spec: `specs/spec.md` (GitHub issue #4). Design source: `specs/design-notes.md`
(now VERIFIED, see its own status line — supersedes its own 2026-09-19 approximate
capture).
Contract: `specs/vacancy.yml` (OpenAPI 3.1.1, `jobzy-contracts` VacancyApi, copied as-of 2026-09-19).
Task list: `specs/tasks.md` (Speckit-style task IDs T001-T043, this plan is their source of truth).
Companion ADRs: `.claude/adr/0001-runtime-config-mechanism.md`,
`.claude/adr/0002-hours-per-week-edit-after-creation.md`,
`.claude/adr/0003-design-token-adoption.md`, `.claude/adr/0004-dropdown-implementation.md`,
`.claude/adr/0005-holiday-period-input.md`.

This file is also mirrored at `.claude/planning/vacancy-creation.md` for
`jobzy-frontend-developer`'s workflow, which reads plans from that fixed path. If the two
ever diverge, `specs/plan.md` is the source of truth — copy forward into the mirror.

---

## 1. Contract findings that shape this plan (read this first)

Before laying out FSD slices: `specs/vacancy.yml` has two things that change what's
buildable in this pass. Both are cross-team contract issues, not FE bugs — flag upstream
to `jobzy-contracts`/backend, don't try to route around them cleverly client-side.

1. **`VacancyUpdateRequest` (the `PATCH /vacancy/{id}` body) cannot carry hours-per-week.**
   `VacancyCoreRequest` and `VacancyResponse` both use `minHoursPerWeek`/`maxHoursPerWeek`,
   but `VacancyUpdateRequest` only has a single `hoursPerWeek` field that doesn't exist
   anywhere else in the schema (`required` on `VacancyCoreRequest`/`VacancyResponse` also
   lists a nonexistent `hoursPerWeek` alongside the real min/max properties — almost
   certainly a copy-paste leftover across three schemas). Practical effect: once a
   vacancy is created via `POST /vacancy`, there is no contract-valid way to change its
   hours-per-week afterward. See ADR-0002 for the resolution.
2. **`SalaryPeriod` enum has no `DAILY`** (`HOURLY`/`MONTHLY`/`ANNUAL` only), but the
   design describes a "per-dag" option in the Salarisperiode dropdown. Resolution:
   build the Step 3 dropdown from the API enum (source of truth), i.e. 3 options, not 4.
   Confirmed unchanged by the verified design pass — flagged in `specs/open-questions.md`.

Everything below assumes these two resolutions. `specs/vacancy.yml` uses singular
`/vacancy` (not `/vacancies`) — confirmed still consistent with the design handoff's own
`Jobzy_Vacancy_OpenAPI_Instructions.md` illustrative examples (which use plural as a
generic illustration, not this repo's actual contract); no drift found between this
repo's contract and the design handoff's assumptions about staged creation, JSON Merge
Patch semantics, or the `/publish` endpoint's existence.

## 2. Tech setup (already implemented, unchanged)

- Vite + React 19 + TypeScript strict, `src/` houses all FSD layers. Already scaffolded.
- `openapi-typescript`-generated types committed at
  `src/shared/api/generated/vacancy-api.ts`. Unchanged.
- Vitest + React Testing Library; Playwright for the one `create-vacancy` flow (§7,
  T017, already implemented — extend, don't replace, per §10.7 below).
- Steiger + FSD ESLint boundary lint wired into `npm run lint`/CI. Already implemented —
  every new slice in §10 must pass it, no exceptions.
- Runtime config (`public/config.json`, ADR-0001). Unchanged, not touched by this pass.

## 3. FSD layer plan (original — see §10.2 for the revised, current layout)

```
src/
  app/
  pages/
    vacancy-create/
  widgets/
    app-shell/
  features/
    create-vacancy-core/
    generate-vacancy-description/
    edit-vacancy-description/
    edit-vacancy-contact-offer/
    review-vacancy/
  entities/
    vacancy/
    vacancy-description/
    location/
  shared/
    api/
    config/
    lib/
    ui/
```

Import direction is strictly `app → pages → widgets → features → entities → shared`.
This section describes the layout as originally planned and as it exists in the repo
today (all of it is implemented). §10.2 lists exactly what's added/changed on top of it
for design parity — nothing here is deleted, this is additive plus several targeted
reworks of feature internals (not their FSD placement).

### 3.1-3.6

Unchanged from the original pass — `shared/`, `entities/`, `features/`, `widgets/`,
`pages/vacancy-create/`, `app/` are all implemented as originally planned in
`src/`. See the repo itself as the source of truth for what exists; §10 below is the
delta on top of it. (The original prose describing each slice is preserved in git
history / the pre-2026-09-20 version of this file if needed for archaeology — not
reproduced here to avoid this document drifting from the actual code as it evolves.)

## 4. API boundary summary (original — extended in §10.4)

| Concern | Adapter method | Endpoint | Contract status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create vacancy (Step 1, first save) | `vacancyApi.createVacancy` | `POST /vacancy` | Covered |
| Edit core fields (Step 1, resubmit) | `vacancyApi.patchVacancyCore` | `PATCH /vacancy/{id}` | Covered *except hours* — ADR-0002 |
| Start AI generation (Step 2 modal) | `descriptionApi.generateDescription` | `POST /vacancy/{id}/generate-description` | Covered |
| Poll generation status | `descriptionApi.getGenerationStatus` | `GET /vacancy/{id}/generate-description/{generationId}` | Covered |
| Save manual/edited description (Step 3/4) | `descriptionApi.saveDescription` | `POST /vacancy/{id}/description` | Covered |
| Save contact + offer (Step 3) | `vacancyApi.patchVacancyContactOffer` | `PATCH /vacancy/{id}` | Covered |
| **Publish (Preview → Published)** | **`vacancyApi.publishVacancy` — new, §10.4** | `POST /vacancy/{id}/publish` | Covered, not yet wired client-side |

All calls route through `entities/vacancy` or `entities/vacancy-description`'s adapters
— never `fetch`/the generated client directly from a feature, widget, or page. This
discipline is already enforced and must not regress in any of §10's new slices.

## 5. State management (original — extended in §10.5)

Local/component state only, as decided. Unchanged reasoning: wizard state is
single-page, single-user, must not survive navigation or land in `localStorage`/
`sessionStorage` (PII). §10.5 lists the additional state the page must now hold to
support mode choice, view switching, and generation phase.

## 6. PII handling (unchanged)

`ContactPerson` (name, email, phone) is the only candidate/personal-data-shaped input in
this feature. Rules unchanged: never log it, never persist wizard state to browser
storage, `http-client` error logging never echoes `errors[].message` verbatim. The new
preview screen renders the contact line **read-only, on-screen only** — same rule
applies (no analytics event, no storage). The published-confirmation screen shows only
the job title, no PII.

## 7. Test plan (original — extended in §10.6)

Original Vitest/RTL and Playwright plan stands for all already-implemented slices.
§10.6 lists what's added for the new/reworked slices — same standard (real logic gets a
failing-test-first Vitest/RTL case; purely presentational wrappers don't need dedicated
tests, noted explicitly per task rather than silently skipped).

## 8. Architectural risks (original — see §10.8 for new/updated risks)

- **Contract gap (hours-per-week on PATCH)** — unchanged, ADR-0002 still governs.
- Steiger/FSD-lint — already landed (T001), no longer a live risk.
-~~"Design notes are only fully observed for Step 1"~~ — **resolved by this revision**:
  the verified design pass (`specs/design-notes.md`) now covers every screen. See §10.8
  for the risks this revision itself introduces.
- `public/config.json` vs `.env` — unchanged, not touched by this pass.

## 9. Task list (superseded — see §10.9 and `specs/tasks.md`)

`specs/tasks.md` now runs T001-T033: T001-T019 are the original pass (all implemented
and reviewed — do not redo them), T020-T032 are this revision's new/rework tasks
(§10.9), and **T033 is the new, single trailing `[review-gate]` task**, depending on
every implementation task including the original T001-T018 and the new T020-T032 (T019,
the original review-gate, is superseded — its sign-off stands for what it reviewed, but
final sign-off for the feature as a whole now happens at T033).

---

## 10. Design-parity revision (2026-09-20)

Trigger: the real, high-fidelity design handoff (`design_handoff_vacancy_creation/`) is
now available and has been read in full (`specs/design-notes.md` is the verified
capture, cited by README section throughout). The first implementation pass shipped
against approximate, Step-1-only-observed design notes; this revision closes every gap
between what's built and what the real handoff specifies, for **full parity**: all
screens, all modals, all tokens, tablet-down-to-1024px responsiveness. Confirmed scope
with the user: no mobile (<640px) support required, matching the design's own
"not designed yet" note.

### 10.1 What's a style gap vs. what's a real behavioural gap

Read this before assigning tasks — it changes how much rework each task actually is.

**Pure style/token gaps** (component exists, logic is right, CSS needs to match the real
tokens): navbar chrome, Step 1's pill toggle styling, card/input/button visual chrome
across every step, salary/contact grid layout, chip/badge styling in the (new) preview
screen.

**Real behavioural gaps** (logic itself is missing or shaped wrong, not just unstyled):

1. **Step 2 is currently a dual-panel step (AI inputs + manual fields shown together);
   the design is a mode-choice step** (`design-notes.md` "Step 2 — Vacaturetekst").
   `mode: null | 'manual' | 'ai'` doesn't exist as page state today.
2. **The 3-questions modal doesn't exist.** AI question inputs are currently inline on
   step 2, not gated behind step 2's "Volgende" via a modal.
3. **Step 3 doesn't have two variants.** Description editing currently happens entirely
   on step 2 (`edit-vacancy-description`); the design puts it on step 3 (manual mode
   only) or shows a generating/ready banner instead (AI mode).
4. **Step 4 ("Overzicht") is read-only today; the design makes it editable** — job
   description sections are editable textareas with per-section "Opnieuw" regenerate in
   AI mode, plus "Aanpassen" links back to steps 1 and 3, plus skeleton loading while
   generation is in flight.
5. **No "Liever niet delen" salary-hidden checkbox** — `edit-vacancy-contact-offer`
   always shows salary fields.
6. **The Stepper is presentational only** — no click-to-navigate, no reachability
   gating (steps 3-4 blocked until a mode is chosen).
7. **"Concept opgeslagen" is rendered inside the Step 1 card**, not page-level next to
   the H1 as the design specifies — needs lifting to `pages/vacancy-create`.
8. **Preview view, Published view, and the publish-confirmation modal don't exist at
   all** — entirely new screens/features, no prior partial implementation to build on.
9. **`vacancyApi` has no `publishVacancy` method** — `POST /vacancy/{id}/publish` is in
   the contract and unused.
10. **The account-menu dropdown is a static list**, not an interactive open/close menu
    with outside-click dismissal.
11. **Dropdowns are unstyled native `<select>`s** with no ISO2 mono suffix for Land —
    see ADR-0004 for the resolution (restyled native `<select>`, not a rebuild).

### 10.2 Revised FSD layer plan

Additive on top of the existing tree (§3), nothing removed:

```
src/
  app/
    styles/tokens.css          — REPLACED wholesale, ADR-0003 (T020)
  widgets/
    app-shell/                 — REWORKED: real chrome, icons, interactive account menu (T021)
  features/
    choose-vacancy-text-mode/  — NEW: Step 2 mode-choice UI (T023)
    generate-vacancy-description/  — REWORKED: owns the 3-questions modal +
                                      a `useGenerateVacancyDescription` phase hook,
                                      no longer renders inline on step 2 (T024)
    edit-vacancy-description/  — REWORKED: moves to Step 3 (manual variant only),
                                  drops the "Volgende" duplication with step 4 (T025)
    edit-vacancy-contact-offer/ — REWORKED: two variants (manual adds description
                                   fields; both add "Liever niet delen" + AI banner) (T026)
    review-vacancy/            — REWORKED: editable Overzicht, skeletons, "Opnieuw",
                                  "Aanpassen" links, "Bekijk je vacature" → view switch (T027)
    preview-vacancy/           — NEW: candidate's-view screen (T028)
    publish-vacancy/           — NEW: publish-confirmation modal + publish call +
                                  the Published confirmation screen (same lifecycle,
                                  kept together — see reasoning below) (T029)
  entities/
    vacancy/
      api/vacancyApi.ts        — add `publishVacancy` (T022)
  shared/
    ui/
      Modal.tsx                — NEW: generic modal (focus trap, Escape, scrim),
                                  used by both new modals (T020b)
      Skeleton.tsx              — NEW: animated bar loading primitive (T020b)
      Checkbox.tsx              — NEW: "Liever niet delen" (T020b)
      ChoiceCard.tsx            — NEW: the two Step 2 mode cards' shared shell (T020b)
```

**FSD placement reasoning for the two new features:**

- `features/preview-vacancy` — a verb-noun feature ("preview the vacancy"), reads the
  in-memory `VacancyResponse` (no new GET), renders the candidate-facing layout, and
  exposes the footer actions (Terug/Bewaren als concept/Publiceer vacature). It's
  feature-shaped (one clear user action: review-as-candidate + trigger publish intent),
  not a widget — it's used on exactly one page, same reasoning as the existing stepper
  pragmatic-call precedent in §3.4.
- `features/publish-vacancy` — owns the **publish lifecycle** end to end: the
  confirmation modal, the `publishVacancy` call, and the resulting Published screen.
  These three are kept in one feature (not three) because they're one state machine
  (`idle → confirming → publishing → published`), not three independent concerns; splitting
  them would force the page to shuttle publish-in-flight state between three feature
  boundaries for no reuse benefit (none of the three pieces is independently reusable
  elsewhere). If a future page ever needs to trigger a publish-confirmation modal
  without the full-page Published screen (e.g. a future vacancies-list page's "publish"
  row action), split `PublishConfirmModal` out at that point — not preemptively now.
- Neither feature imports the other's internals; the page (`pages/vacancy-create`)
  orchestrates `view` transitions between them, per existing FSD discipline (features
  don't import sideways).

### 10.3 Public API / index.ts discipline for the new slices

- `features/choose-vacancy-text-mode/index.ts` exports `<VacancyTextModeChoice>` only
  (props: `mode`, `onModeChange`, `onNext` — page owns `mode` state, this feature is a
  controlled component, consistent with the existing pattern of features not owning
  cross-step state themselves).
- `features/generate-vacancy-description/index.ts` exports `<ThreeQuestionsModal>`,
  `useGenerateVacancyDescription()` (the phase/poll hook), and its existing types. The
  hook is the seam `review-vacancy` (for skeletons/"Opnieuw") and
  `edit-vacancy-contact-offer` (for the generating/ready banner) both need — **it must
  live here, not be duplicated**, since this feature already owns the
  generate+poll API calls. Both consumers receive `phase`/`result`/`regenerate` via
  props from the page, which holds the hook instance — features still don't import each
  other directly.
- `features/preview-vacancy/index.ts` exports `<VacancyPreview>` only.
- `features/publish-vacancy/index.ts` exports `<PublishConfirmModal>`,
  `<PublishedConfirmation>`, and `usePublishVacancy()` (owns the `publishVacancy` call +
  its own loading/error state — page doesn't need to know the HTTP details, just
  `publish(): Promise<VacancyResponse>` and a `publishing`/`error` pair).
- `shared/ui/index.ts` gains `Modal`, `Skeleton`, `Checkbox`, `ChoiceCard` exports.

No feature reaches into another feature's or entity's internals beyond its `index.ts` —
this doesn't change from the original plan's discipline.

### 10.4 API boundary additions

| Concern | Adapter method | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Publish (Preview → Published) | `vacancyApi.publishVacancy(id): Promise<VacancyResponse>` | `POST /vacancy/{id}/publish` |

No other new endpoint is needed — every other new screen reads the already-in-memory
`VacancyResponse`/`VacancyDescriptionResponse` the wizard already holds. `publishVacancy`
must surface a `409 Conflict` (illegal transition, per the contract's Problem Details
spec) as a visible `ErrorBanner` in the publish-confirmation modal, not a silent failure
or an uncaught rejection — same unhappy-path discipline as every other adapter call.

### 10.5 State management additions

`pages/vacancy-create/ui/VacancyCreatePage.tsx` gains, on top of its existing
`currentStep`/`vacancy`/`generatedDraft` state:

- `view: 'wizard' | 'preview' | 'published'` — drives which top-level screen renders.
- `mode: null | 'manual' | 'ai'` — set by `choose-vacancy-text-mode`, gates step 2's
  "Volgende" (disabled while `null`) and steps 3-4's stepper-click reachability.
- `questionsOpen: boolean` — 3-questions modal visibility.
- `confirmOpen: boolean` — publish-confirmation modal visibility.
- `hasSaved: boolean` / `savedAt: string | undefined` — lifted up from
  `create-vacancy-core` (which currently owns this locally); rendered next to the H1,
  not inside the step 1 card. `create-vacancy-core` calls `onSaved` (already does) and
  the page sets `hasSaved`/`savedAt` from that, same as it already threads `onSaved`
  into `setVacancy`.
- The generation phase (`idle | generating | ready | failed`) lives in the
  `useGenerateVacancyDescription()` hook instance the page holds (§10.3) — not
  duplicated as separate page state.

Still no store library — this is still genuinely page-local, single-user state; the
addition of `view`/`mode`/modal-open booleans doesn't change the reasoning in §5, it's
just more of the same kind of state.

### 10.6 Test plan additions

**Vitest + RTL:**

- `shared/ui/Modal` — traps focus, closes on Escape and on scrim click, returns focus
  to the trigger on close.
- `shared/ui/Skeleton`, `Checkbox`, `ChoiceCard` — `Skeleton` and `Checkbox` get a
  cheap render/interaction test (checked state toggles, ARIA); `ChoiceCard` is mostly
  presentational (selected/unselected classNames) — a single snapshot-style assertion is
  enough, don't over-test styling per the existing plan's own explicit note.
- `features/choose-vacancy-text-mode` — "Volgende" disabled until a mode is picked,
  label changes to "Beantwoord 3 vragen" in AI mode, `onNext` fires with the chosen mode.
- `features/generate-vacancy-description` — `ThreeQuestionsModal` submit calls
  `generateDescription` + starts polling and closes itself; `useGenerateVacancyDescription`
  hook's phase transitions (`idle→generating→ready`, `idle→generating→failed`) with fake
  timers, `regenerate(section)` re-triggers generation and only replaces the requested
  section (see open-questions.md new #10 on this simplification's exact shape).
- `features/edit-vacancy-contact-offer` — "Liever niet delen" hides the salary grid and
  clears/nulls salary fields on save; AI-mode banner reflects the shared generation
  phase (`generating` violet / `ready` teal) via a prop, not its own polling.
- `features/review-vacancy` — skeleton renders while `phase === 'generating'`; editable
  textareas save via `saveDescription`; "Opnieuw" wired to `regenerate`; "Aanpassen"
  links call the page's step-navigation callback with the right target step.
- `features/preview-vacancy` — renders chips/sections from a given `VacancyResponse`;
  "Solliciteren" is disabled; "Publiceer vacature" opens `confirmOpen` (assert via the
  callback prop, not by reaching into `publish-vacancy`'s internals).
- `features/publish-vacancy` — modal calls `publishVacancy` on confirm, surfaces a 409
  as a visible error and does not transition `view`; on success transitions to
  `PublishedConfirmation` with the vacancy title.
- `widgets/app-shell` — account menu opens on click, closes on outside mousedown,
  matches the existing `[data-dd]`-equivalent pattern.
- `pages/vacancy-create` — full click-through **twice**: once for manual mode (step 1 →
  step 2 choose manual → step 3 manual variant → step 4 → preview → publish → published),
  once for AI mode (step 2 choose AI → 3-questions modal → step 3 AI variant/banner →
  step 4 skeleton → ready → preview → publish → published) — this is the actual
  integration surface that proves the mode-branching behaviour end to end, more valuable
  here than in either individual feature's isolated test.
- Tablet-width regression: a component/page test asserting the multi-field grids
  (`repeat(auto-fit, minmax(...))`) don't require a media query to reflow — assert via
  computed style or a snapshot at a reduced container width if the test setup supports
  it; if not practically assertable in JSDOM (grid reflow is a real-layout concern
  JSDOM doesn't compute), downgrade this to a manual verification step recorded in the
  task summary (open a real browser at ~800px width) rather than a fake-passing test.

**Playwright** — extend the existing single `create-vacancy` flow (T017) rather than
adding a second flow: it must now also exercise the mode choice (manual, to keep it
deterministic — same reasoning as the original plan), the new step 4 editable overzicht,
the preview screen, and the publish confirmation through to the Published screen. This
is still the one canonical end-to-end flow for this feature — extending it to its now-
longer real length is the right call, not a second Playwright test for "preview" or
"published" in isolation.

### 10.7 Responsive (tablet, down to ~768-1024px)

No new component-level task beyond what §10.2's CSS rework already requires — this is a
cross-cutting CSS discipline applied while building every new/reworked slice, not a
separate feature. Task T032 is a dedicated **verification** pass (not new
implementation): resize every screen down to 768px and 1024px and confirm every
`repeat(auto-fit, minmax(...))` grid (Step 1's Land+Stad and hours-min/max rows, Step
3's contact and salary rows, Step 2's choice-card grid) reflows to single/double column
without a horizontal scrollbar or clipped content, and that header rows (`flex-wrap:
wrap`) don't overlap. Record pass/fail per screen in the task summary. Confirmed with
the user: no mobile (<640px) support required.

### 10.8 Architectural risks (this revision)

- **Shared generation-phase hook fan-out** (§10.3): `useGenerateVacancyDescription`'s
  phase now drives three consumers (step 3's banner, step 4's skeleton/regenerate, and
  the modal that starts it) via page-held state instead of each owning its own polling.
  Real risk if a future developer reaches for a second polling instance "for
  convenience" instead of threading the existing one through props — would silently
  double the generation calls against the backend. Mitigate by making this explicit in
  the task instructions (T024, T026, T027) and flagging it again at the review gate.
- **Step 4 becoming editable is a bigger behavioural change than a visual one** — the
  original plan's `review-vacancy` was deliberately read-only ("no new GET call needed…
  every section was already persisted"). It's still true no new GET is needed, but
  "editable" means step 4 now makes its own `saveDescription` PATCH calls, which the
  original plan's architecture didn't anticipate. Not a layering violation (still routes
  through `entities/vacancy-description`'s existing adapter), but worth naming so nobody
  mistakes this for scope creep — it's a confirmed, cited design requirement
  (`design-notes.md` "Step 4 — Overzicht: editable, not read-only"), not an invented one.
- **"Opnieuw" (regenerate) has no dedicated backend endpoint** — the contract only has
  one `generate-description` call producing the whole description in one shot. Per-section
  regenerate is a client-side simplification (re-run generation, keep only the requested
  section's new value, discard the rest) — see open-questions.md new #10. Low severity
  (cosmetic mismatch between "feels like per-section AI" and "actually re-runs the whole
  generation"), but worth a human confirming this UX reads honestly rather than
  misleadingly before it ships.
- **Logo/icon assets are reconstructions, not final brand files** (`design-notes.md`
  "Assets") — low severity, cosmetic, flagged for a pre-ship swap, not blocking this
  pass.
- **New `lucide-react` dependency** — first icon library in this codebase; low risk, but
  note it in the task summary so it's visible in the diff rather than silently appearing
  in `package.json`.

### 10.9 New/revised task list

See `specs/tasks.md` T020-T033 for the ordered, ID-tagged breakdown. T020-T032 are
implementation tasks (all traceable to this section); T033 is the single trailing
`[review-gate]` task depending on all of T001-T018 and T020-T032.

## 11. Fine-tuning pass (2026-09-25)

Trigger: the PO (Martijn) browser-tested the shipped, design-parity build (open PR
`MartijnvCitteren/Jobzy-Frontend#5`, `feature/4-redesign-vacancy-creation`) and reported
5 issues. Root causes below are diagnosed against the actual current code, not
guessed. This is a **polish pass** — no new screens, no new FSD slices; T034-T042 rework
existing slices in place, T043 is this pass's own single review gate.

### 11.1 Issues → root cause → fix, by FSD location

1. **Card heading/description spacing** (step 1, and — for consistency — every other
   card with an intro line). `shared/ui/Card` is `display:flex; flex-direction:column;
   gap: var(--space-3)` (24px between *every* child, including a heading and its very
   next paragraph), and `VacancyCoreForm`'s `<p>` inherits body-copy size. Fix: a new
   `shared/ui/CardHeader` primitive (`title`, `description?`, `level?: 2 | 3`, default
   `2`) that groups heading+description at `gap: var(--space-1)` (8px, not the card's
   24px), description in `--text-secondary` at `--text-ui-size` (14px) — matching the
   design tokens' own "helper/meta" scale. Adopted in `create-vacancy-core`
   (Basisgegevens), `choose-vacancy-text-mode` (Vacaturetekst — choose view), and
   `review-vacancy` (Overzicht, "Alles staat er…"); also adopted (heading only, bumped
   `h3`→`h2`) in `edit-vacancy-description` once it becomes a standalone step-2 view
   under item 2 below, since it's no longer a co-located sub-card next to another `h2`.
   Exported from `shared/ui/index.ts`.

2. **Vacaturetekst and Contact en voorwaarden must be separate pages (manual mode).**
   Today `pages/vacancy-create/ui/VacancyCreatePage.tsx` (lines ~116-133) renders
   `VacancyDescriptionEditor` **and** `VacancyContactOfferForm` stacked on step 3 when
   `mode === 'manual'`. New: step 2 gets a page-local sub-view,
   `step2View: 'choose' | 'write'` (only meaningful in manual mode). Choosing "Zelf
   schrijven" and clicking "Volgende" sets `step2View: 'write'` and **stays on step 2**
   (stepper label unchanged: "Vacaturetekst") instead of jumping to step 3. The write
   view renders `edit-vacancy-description`'s editor alone, with a normal primary
   **"Volgende"** button (not the current italic "Concept opslaan" — delete
   `.saveDraftButton`'s `font-style: italic` from `VacancyDescriptionEditor.module.css`
   and rename the label) that calls `saveDescription` and *then* advances to step 3.
   Step 3 now renders **only** `edit-vacancy-contact-offer` in both modes (the AI-mode
   branch already did this — the two `currentStep === 3` JSX branches on the page
   collapse into one, `mode` still threaded through for the banner). Returning to step 2
   via the Stepper shows whatever `step2View` was last left on — a small ghost "Terug
   naar tekstkeuze" link on the write view resets it to `'choose'` so the user can switch
   mode; nothing is ever trapped, and this needs no new state beyond the one enum.
   `mode`/`step2View` stay page-local, no store (§5/§10.5 reasoning unchanged).

   **Deliberate divergence from the design handoff**, recorded here per the PO's explicit
   request rather than silently decided: `design-notes.md` "Step 3 — Contact en
   voorwaarden: two real variants" specifies the manual variant as *one* card with
   description textareas **plus** contact + salary blocks together. The PO tested the
   build in a browser and explicitly asked for these as two separate pages instead — his
   tested, in-product feedback supersedes the design mock here. Not an ADR (it's a
   product-priority call about page composition, not an architecture trade-off with
   competing technical consequences) — flagged so a future pass doesn't "fix" this back
   to match `design-notes.md`.

3. **Textareas resize wider than the card.** `shared/ui/fields.module.css`'s `.control`
   has no `width`/`max-width`, and a `<textarea>` defaults to `resize: both`. Global fix
   in `shared/ui` (not per-feature, since every multiline field shares this class):
   `.control { width: 100%; max-width: 100%; }`, plus `textarea.control { resize:
   vertical; }` to stop horizontal resize specifically.

4. **Vakantiedagen** (`edit-vacancy-contact-offer/ui/VacancyContactOfferForm.tsx`):
   a. The Salarisperiode `<select>` visually overflows its `repeat(auto-fit,
      minmax(150px, 1fr))` grid cell and covers "Aantal vakantiedagen" next to it. Item
      3's width fix removes the intrinsic-width overflow itself, but CSS Grid tracks
      don't shrink a native `<select>`'s intrinsic min-width just because a sibling has
      `width: 100%` — add `min-width: 0` to `.salaryGrid > *` as the actual fix for the
      grid-track collapse, on top of item 3.
   b. Real bug: `numberOfHolidays` is rendered inside the `{!hideSalary && …}` block
      (line 176), so "Liever niet delen" hides holidays too, even though holidays aren't
      salary. Fix: pull it out into its own always-visible row (`grid-column: 1 / -1`,
      full width — also directly addresses 4a's crowding by giving it more room),
      rendered regardless of `hideSalary`.
   c. **New requirement**: a period selector (week/maand/jaar) for vakantiedagen.
      Contract gap — `Offer.numberOfHolidays` is a bare `number | null`, "Full-time-
      equivalent holiday days… never pre-computed/prorated server-side", no period
      field. Resolved by **ADR-0005** (client-side conversion to annual FTE days before
      the API call; upstream `jobzy-contracts` ask filed in `open-questions.md`).

5. **Overzicht (step 4)**, `features/review-vacancy/ui/ReviewVacancy.tsx`:
   a. Meta line (`{category} · {city} · {workplaceType}`) lacks weekly hours.
      `VacancyPreview.tsx:41` already inlines equivalent-but-not-quite-right JSX
      (`{min}–{max} uur per week`, always a range, never collapses when equal) — extract
      one `entities/vacancy/lib/hours.ts` (`formatHoursPerWeek(min, max)`: `"40 uur per
      week"` when `min === max`, else `"32–40 uur per week"`) and use it in both
      `review-vacancy` and `preview-vacancy` instead of leaving two near-duplicate
      formatters to drift (same reasoning `formatSalary` already followed).
   b. Textareas are always editable (no read-only state), each section's label renders
      twice (the section header *and* `TextField`'s own `label` prop both show the same
      text), and a bare `<hr />` inside the flex-column `Card` renders as a stray "."
      instead of a visible rule. Fix: sections render as read-only
      `<p style="white-space: pre-wrap">` by default; each section's own "Aanpassen"
      swaps *only that section* into an editable textarea with "Opslaan"/"Annuleren"
      ("Opslaan" → `saveDescription` with the full current `values` object — same
      whole-object PATCH the API already expects, no new endpoint; "Annuleren" → revert
      that field to the last-saved value, close edit mode). "Bekijk je vacature" is
      disabled while any section is mid-edit — simplest guard against silently losing an
      open edit, no autosave-on-navigate needed. Add a `hideLabel?: boolean` option to
      `shared/ui/TextField` (visually-hidden label, `sr-only`, keeps the accessible name)
      so edit mode doesn't re-render a second visible label. Divider: replace `<hr />`
      with an explicit `<div className={styles.divider} aria-hidden="true" />`
      (`border-top: 1px solid var(--border-hairline); height: 0;`). "Opnieuw"/skeleton
      behaviour for AI mode is unchanged.
   c. The contact block only renders when `vacancy.contactPerson` is truthy, and there's
      no holiday-days line next to the salary line. Root cause is **not** this
      component — see §11.2. Fix here: always render the contact block
      (name/role/phone/email) and a holiday-days line (via ADR-0005's formatter,
      preferring the page-local `holidayInput` if present, else reconstructing from
      `vacancy.offer.numberOfHolidays` as a plain annual figure) once §11.2 makes
      `vacancy` reliably carry what was submitted.
   d. "Bekijk je vacature" moves from a sibling of the `Card` into the `Card` itself, in
      a right-aligned footer row (`justify-content: flex-end`).

### 11.2 Page-level data-loss fix (root cause behind issue 5c)

`ReviewVacancy` only ever renders what's on its `vacancy` prop, and
`VacancyCreatePage` replaces its `vacancy` state **wholesale** with each PATCH response
(the `onSaved` callbacks at `VacancyCreatePage.tsx:127,141`, and `handleCoreSaved`).
`specs/vacancy.yml`'s `VacancyResponse` does **not** list `contactPerson`/`offer` as
`required` — a response that omits a section the user just submitted is contract-legal,
and nothing in the current code defends against it. This matches the PO's exact repro
(contact person and salary both filled in, both missing at Overzicht).

**Decision: the merge lives inside each form's own save handler**
(`VacancyContactOfferForm.save`, `VacancyCoreForm.save`), not at the page level:
- *Pragmatic (chosen)* — each `save()` already holds both the just-submitted payload and
  the raw API response in scope; before calling `onSaved`, merge:
  `{ ...response, contactPerson: response.contactPerson ?? submittedContactPerson, offer:
  response.offer ?? submittedOffer }` in `VacancyContactOfferForm`, and the equivalent for
  `minHoursPerWeek`/`maxHoursPerWeek` in `VacancyCoreForm`'s `patchVacancyCore` branch
  (source: its own `values`, which mirror `initialValues` since hours are disabled/
  read-only post-creation per ADR-0002). This keeps `onSaved(vacancy: VacancyResponse)`
  a contract the page can keep trusting as "complete enough," instead of making the page
  track submitted-vs-returned state per form. No cross-feature import is needed either
  way (each form only reasons about its own submission), so this doesn't touch the
  "features don't import each other" rule — not an ADR-level call, just recorded here.
- *Strict variant (rejected for now)* — page-level merge, with a parallel "last-
  submitted" shadow per section held on `VacancyCreatePage`. More correct in the
  abstract (one place owns "what does the user think is saved"), but adds page state
  surface for a defensive edge case two small feature-local patches already close.
  Revisit if a third form needs the same treatment and duplicating the pattern a third
  time starts to hurt.

### 11.3 State additions

`pages/vacancy-create/ui/VacancyCreatePage.tsx` gains:

- `step2View: 'choose' | 'write'` (default `'choose'`) — §11.1 item 2.
- `holidayInput: { amount: number; period: HolidayPeriod } | undefined` — set from
  `edit-vacancy-contact-offer`'s save (via `onSaved` or a small dedicated
  `onHolidayInputChange` prop, developer's call), threaded as a prop into
  `review-vacancy` and `preview-vacancy` so both can display the period the user
  actually chose, in-session (ADR-0005). Still page-local, single-session, never written
  to browser storage — same reasoning as §10.5, just one more field of the same kind.

### 11.4 API boundary

No new endpoints and no contract change required to ship this pass. `numberOfHolidays`
is still sent as a single annual-FTE number — the client converts week/month → annual
before the existing `patchVacancyContactOffer` call (ADR-0005). The upstream
`jobzy-contracts` ask (a `holidayPeriod` field on `Offer`, mirroring `SalaryPeriod`'s
shape) is flagged in `specs/open-questions.md`, not blocking this pass.

### 11.5 Test plan additions

**Vitest + RTL** (failing-test-first for real logic; presentational-only bits noted
explicitly rather than silently skipped, per the plan's existing convention):

- `shared/ui/CardHeader` — renders `title` at the right heading level plus
  `description`; omits the `<p>` when no `description` is passed.
- `entities/vacancy/lib/hours.test.ts` — `formatHoursPerWeek`: collapse-when-equal case,
  range case.
- `entities/vacancy/lib/holidays.test.ts` — `toAnnualHolidayDays`/
  `fromAnnualHolidayDays` per period (week ×52, month ×12, year ×1) and
  `formatHolidayDays`'s output strings.
- `edit-vacancy-contact-offer` — vakantiedagen renders and stays visible with "Liever
  niet delen" checked (regression test for 4b); changing the period Select changes the
  *converted* value in the outgoing `patchVacancyContactOffer` call body, not just
  on-screen state; merge-on-response-omission case from §11.2 (mock a response missing
  `contactPerson`/`offer`, assert `onSaved` still receives the submitted values).
- `create-vacancy-core` — same merge case for `minHoursPerWeek`/`maxHoursPerWeek` on the
  `patchVacancyCore` path.
- `edit-vacancy-description` — save button renders "Volgende" (not "Concept opslaan"),
  calls `saveDescription` then the page-supplied advance callback.
- `review-vacancy` — read-only-by-default sections; "Aanpassen" → editable → "Opslaan"
  calls `saveDescription`, "Annuleren" reverts without calling it; "Bekijk je vacature"
  disabled while any section is mid-edit; contact block and holiday-days line render
  unconditionally once `vacancy` carries them; "Bekijk je vacature" renders inside the
  `Card`'s DOM subtree.
- `pages/vacancy-create` — update the existing manual-mode click-through: step 2 choose
  → write view → step 3 (contact-only, no description fields present) → step 4; one
  assertion that returning to step 2 via the Stepper after a manual draft exists lands
  on `'write'`, not `'choose'`.

**Playwright** — extend `e2e/create-vacancy.spec.ts` (no new spec file): the manual path
now fills Samenvatting and clicks "Volgende" on step 2's write view (landing on step 3
with only contact fields, not "Concept opslaan" immediately followed by contact fields
on the same page), and exercises one Overzicht "Aanpassen" → edit → "Opslaan" round-trip
before "Bekijk je vacature". Still the one canonical flow this feature earns.

### 11.6 PII

No new PII surface introduced. `ContactPerson` remains the only PII-shaped data in this
feature; §6's rules are unchanged (on-screen only, never logged, never persisted to
browser storage, never sent to analytics). The behaviour change in 5c/§11.2 makes
contact details render *unconditionally* once present, rather than conditionally on a
truthiness check — this is a data-loss bug fix (previously-submitted data was being
silently dropped, not legitimately absent), not a new exposure.

### 11.7 Risks

- **Per-section save-in-Overzicht is a real UX/complexity increase over "one save on
  Volgende"** (5b) — low-to-medium severity: more surface for a user to leave a section
  mid-edit. Mitigated by disabling "Bekijk je vacature" during an open edit rather than
  risking silent loss; worth a human sanity-check at review that this reads as helpful
  friction rather than an annoyance.
- **Client-side annual-FTE conversion (ADR-0005) means the chosen input period doesn't
  survive a backend round-trip** — low severity now (this is a session-only wizard, no
  "resume an existing draft" flow in scope), but will become a real gap the moment such
  a flow is built; the ADR names the upstream fix that closes it.
- **Feature-local merge (§11.2) is a narrow, repeatable pattern, not a general
  mechanism** — fine for two forms; if a third form develops the same "response may omit
  what I just sent" shape, that's the signal to revisit the page-level alternative
  instead of copying the pattern a third time.

### 11.8 Task list

See `specs/tasks.md` T034-T042 for the ordered, ID-tagged breakdown (all traceable to
this section via `Plan: §11.x`); T043 is this pass's single trailing `[review-gate]`,
depending on all of T034-T042. T001-T033 already carry T033's own sign-off and aren't
re-reviewed here — the reviewer should still sanity-check that nothing in T034-T042
regresses what T033 already approved (FSD boundaries, API-boundary discipline, PII
handling, the shared-generation-hook single-instance discipline).
